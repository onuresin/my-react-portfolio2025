    "desc": "My goal is to combine my experience from various sectors with technology and shape my career as a Frontend Developer.\nI graduated from Balıkesir University with a degree in Economics, then worked in foreign trade and marketing. My experiences from 2017-2023 in these sectors, along with my passion for technology and creation, led me to software development.\nWith the Advanced Software Specialist training at Acun Medya Academy, I built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I reinforced my skills by developing many projects during this period (see my portfolio for details).\nCurrently, I work in the IT department at Aka College and continuously improve myself in frontend development. Thanks to my teamwork skills, analytical thinking, and solution-oriented approach, I'm ready to take an active role in new projects.\nMy aim is to become a frontend developer who values user experience, focuses on performance, and creates sustainable, impactful interfaces.",
